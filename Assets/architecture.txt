The architecture of this game:
    Game is the entry point of the game
        
        Managers contain most core game data and post events about the data changing
        
        Controllers control the game and what is actually happening
            WorldController controls the main world of the game
                MiningPointController controls the mining points in the game
                AreaController controls displaying the areas in the game
            UIController controls the UI of the game
                MenuController controls the menus of the game
                etc

        Coordinators are things that are responsible for making certain sequences of events to occur like entering a battle, dying in a battle, completing a quest, encountering a quest giver, etc.

        Things without these postfixs/catagories are components and shouldn't know about the rest of the game. They should take in data through an initialization function and post events for the controller code.
