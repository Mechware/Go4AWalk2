    Text: 'K, so here''s the thing. These two gnomes have been walking around going
      off about the dualist nature of the mind and body and whether or not consiousness
      can arise from the physical brain or if it is a non-physical phenomena.


      Anyway, its getting real annoying. Kill them for me.'

  EndConversation:
    Text: 'Wow, you actually just killed those gnomes for no reason other than I found
      them annoying. Congrats, you''re a monster.
