  Description: 'Armor has 4 main stats: No block modifier, block modifier, perfect
    block modifier, damage additive modifier. No block modifier is the number that
    the incoming damage is multiplied by when you are not blocking, block modifier
    is the modifier when you''re blocking, perfect block modifier is the modifier
    when you perform a perfect block, and damage additive modifier is the amount of
    damage subtracted from the incoming damage. So if you''re blocking, damage = EnemyAttack
    * block modifier - damage additive modifier.'
